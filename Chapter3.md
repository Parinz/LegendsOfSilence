### Rehabilitation


*"I'm a walking demon with a phantom limb, what could go wrong now?"* Snake laughed at the thought as he smoked his phantom cigar-- it's faint glow dimly lighting up secluded part of Mother Base. He had been on 7 or 8 missions now and that had more than warmed up his skills. His mind, however, was thinking about his memories that had more or less surfaced up in the hospital.

It seemed that every time he recalled one of them something very minor would change, from the placement of an object, to the colors of the wall, or even the location of a door. He couldn't shake the feeling as if his memories weren't his own. His metallic arm got his attention as he could feel the pain, which originated from his left fingertips.

"Phantom pain huh?" he recalled Ocelot's words. "This is what I have now, so I better get use to it," he said as he proceeded towards the R&D platform to do some target practice.

Pain. Excruciating pain. Jane came to her senses as she took notice of her surroundings. *"Huh, now I'm in the same situation as that bastard,"* she said as she saw herself lying on a hospital bed with various equipments around her. She tensed her muscles instinctively but relaxed when she saw the XOF logos.

She examined her body to see that it looked *perfect*, perhaps even more so than before the fire.

*"The fire? Wait what? How?"*

Her questions were soon answered as her "father" entered into the room, "Hello there. You've failed your mission. You know what that means now."

Jane glared Skull Face, *"So you saved me, just to kill me?"*.

"Hah, now don't think I'll kill you now," he scoffed before continuing, "I've taken the liberty of giving you a *second chance*, and this time, you will not screw up." He continued after seeing her nod, circling her bed like a predator, "We've applied experimental parasite therapy on to you. You are now one of the Skulls. But you are also unique, because you can think."

Skull Face went on to list out her abilities and her disabilities. Showing to her that the fire had cooked most of her organs. She was, metaphorically speaking, a dead man walking.

"But I would be too kind if you were to be let off without any sort of punishment. You are not Jane. You are now Quiet. A person without a voice," he said before laughing insanely and gesturing to a mask which was over her mouth.

"You see, I've put the English strain into you. I intend for you to use that against the Big Boss himself. You will be deployed into Afghanistan and you will be captured on purpose. You will pretend to defect and possibly seduce him.Big Boss will die from a kiss. However, the English Strain will not activate with a kiss. It will activate when you decide to speak a single word of English. "

To say that Jane was mad was an understatement of the century. She was on fire from her emotions. Her rage was boiling hot. And Skull Face was taking advantage of it. *"You want me to kiss Big Boss? That'll be the day"*, she hated it with every ounce of her living being. She was going to kill Big Boss, but not before he would be tortured by her, made felt the pain that she felt.

Skull Face noticed her glares and laughed, "You won't be coming back, by the way. Once the English Strain activates, you will also be killed. You are also not to kill Big Boss before you seduce him. Otherwise," Skull Face presses a button, which within an instant, caused her to feel as if millions of needles punctured her skin at the same time. Jane screamed into the mask.

She glared at Skull Face once more, furious at his tools, *"How..."*

"Nanomachines, girl. I will see, what you see, hear, what you hear. And if you do not do your task..." Skull Face pressed the button once more. Jane screamed once again. Her body was aching for revenge not only against Big Boss but against Skull Face. She wanted to kill them both, but Big Boss will have to do before she can kill her former mentor.

"You will drop in here, near Serak Power Plant. Then take out these Soviet commanders to make a name for yourself. When Big Boss inevitably passes through these ruins, you will initiate a duel with him where you will be captured, are we clear?" Skull Face said as she nodded. She felt a needle enter her neck as her vision faded to black.
