# Mother Base

With the chopper in close proximity to Mother Base, Snake noticed the two choppers coming up beside them. Each of them having a Diamond Dog sitting on it. Their aim were on Snake, to which he ignored. He wasn't one to be worried about these things. One thing was for sure though, he didn't go through all the trouble just let Quiet get shot.


As stood up beside Snake to observe what was happening, the laser dots moved onto her chest. Snake gave the Diamond Dog a stare that froze his arms, before lifting his left hand to gesture Quiet to sit down and shutting the right door. When the chopper neared the Command Platform he stood up and observed through the opened left door, seeing Miller, Ocelot, and a platoon of Diamond Dogs waiting for him.


*"You're prepared,"* he thought to himself. Although he wouldn't underestimate Quiet's powers, he was certain that she wouldn't be trouble. He knew that Quiet could kill him right then if she wanted to. Something was keeping her from doing so, maybe an order. He just didn't knew yet.


Quiet uncloaked behind Snake a looked through his shoulder, and he could tell, that she knew this was not a common occurrence at Mother Base. Precisely at that moment, his years of combat-hardened senses caught something. A simple reflection, atop the Command Platform.


    A trigger was pulled.
    A woman oblivious.
    But a solider knew.
    
    He grabbed and pulled her,
    her waist on his,
    as his arm went around her.
    
    Yet, he wasn't hers,
    and she wasn't his.
    Boy, wrong they were.


A loud bang came into earshot just as Snake shielded Quiet with his body. His left arm had wrapped around her waist as he spun around and grabbed her. Quiet's reaction was not fast enough to prevent his grip, but she saw the sniper bullet enter the fleshy part of his left arm. Had he not grabbed her, it would've gone straight into her heart. Super-human or not, it would've killed her.

Snake immediately released her once he felt the pain, as to not be inappropriate. He then shut door and told Pequod to circle around Mother Base and open the comms. By this point, he saw most of the Mother Base soldiers scrambling to find the source of the shot. Leaving Miller and Ocelot arguing.


"Miller," Snake spoke into the comms, his voice stone-cold.

"Boss, she's *NOT* setting foot on this base," Miller replied in a cold-voice, yet with respect.

"We won't decide that now, now let us land," Snake spoke, issuing a direct order.

"Yes sir Boss," Miller ordered the Diamond Dogs.


As Snake and Quiet exited the chopper, Miller and Ocelot can be heard arguing about the sniper shot. The Diamond Dog who shot the Boss had been captured and thrown into a cell and the Diamond Dogs were gathered around them.

"Miller! You can not do that again! You almost killed the Boss!" Ocelot shouted.

"It did not hit the Boss," Miller rebutted to which Quiet gestured to Snake's arm.

"You! You stay out of this conversation," Miller's voice burning.

"We'll talk about this later, for now, we have to decide what to do with her," Ocelot said. Miller stayed silent, waiting for the boss to make his decision. 

After a long moment of silence Snake said, "Take her to the cell." Miller begrudgingly ordered the Diamond Dogs platoon to take Quiet to the cell. Miller gave Snake a long stare before before he went his own way. Ocelot simply gave his wounded arm a slap before leaving.

Snake silently followed the platoon of Diamond Dogs to the Medical Platform in order to have them take out the sniper bullet in arm. And he made a mental note to deal with Miller and the Diamond Dog who took the shot.

*"What the **fuck** just happened today,"* Jane thought to herself, not as a question but as a statement. She had hoped that seeing the true colors of Big Boss would help her to kill him more easily, yet she saw a man who was willing to take a bullet for a potentially dangerous woman and every one of his own. Seeing how he immediately released her when he sensed the pain, she knew that he wasn't a pervert either.


Moving her thoughts away from the moral dilemma, she thought about Skull Face. He hasn't tried to shock her using the nano-bots yet, and she was sure that he knew there were guards above her cell. She could imagine that the moment she was alone, she would be electrocuted by Skull Face.


*"The whole ordeal might be a facade,"* Jane thought to herself in a desperate attempt to justify killing Big Boss. She tried to come up with reasons, but, since their earlier meeting, she could not find a reason to kill him. It was inconclusive, it *was* possible that the whole thing was staged. She would have to conduct reconnaissance.


*"The irony,"* she thought to herself. A man whom she tried to kill twice and failed saved her life. While the man who she looked up to as a distant father-figure had plagued her and sent her to die. Jane understood that she had to try to fool Skull Face that she was following his plans. At least until she could find a way to deactivate the nano-bots inside her.


A thought made it's way into her mind, *"What if..."* But just as it came, it went. Jane shook her head, there was no way she would be doing *that*. In an attempt to put her mind to rest she observed her room. Ocelot, or whatever the cowboy's name was, had been kind enough to station female soldiers around her cell instead of male ones. Since she basically had to bath, in public, she was glad that the soldiers were female.


She laid back onto the bed, staring into the night sky.
