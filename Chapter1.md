### Chapter 1: History

"Just another day," Jane said to herself despite wiping out an entire outpost by her own hands, using nothing but a knife. She didn't really feel anything about killing people now. She was just a tool. A tool to be used to kill, and a very effective one. She thought of herself like a pistol, the person using the pistol was the one responsible, not the pistol itself.

Being personally raised by the "great" Skull Face himself, this operation was a walk in the park so far and that had given her some time to think. She reminisced about the last image of her parents. They were supporters of the Soviet Union, yet they were caught up and killed in a firefight between the Russians and Skull Face himself-- albeit he wasn't Skull Face at the time. She found it very ironic as her parents were die-hard communism supporters, yet they were gunned down heartlessly. In an attempt to defend herself she grabbed a knife from a corpse of a soldier near her and picked it up. As another solider came nearby she swiped her knife at his leg injuring him. Skull Face then finished the solider.

"Well, well, well. What do I have here?" she recalled Skull Face asking her a question as he inspected her. As one of the soldiers from his three-man team raised his rifle to aim at her, Skull Face slapped it away. "You feel the need for revenge, don't you?" he asked her in Russian.

"Sir, I don't think--" said the Solider who aimed the rifle at her, however, he was cut short as Skull Face pulled up his silent pistol and shot him through the head-- the blood spattering across his face and hands.

"Any objections, Jack?" Skull Face asked the remaining solider who quickly turned his head left and right frantically.

"Good. Now, do you want *revenge*?" He asked her in Russian as he put forward his blood-splattered right hand as if to shake the 10-year-old girl's hand. She sneered as she tried to take a swipe at his hands. However, Skull Face was faster as he used his other hand and grabbed her hand that held the knife, forcing her to drop it. "That's what I wanted to see. However, you have to learn to use that against the correct people," he said with a grin on his face. "Now, do you want revenge?" He asked her as he released her hand. She nodded.

From that moment on, she was Skull Face's personal assassin. Something she wasn't quite proud off, yet she didn't resent. She was quickly snapped back to reality as she entered the newly-captured outpost's command center. Within a second she noticed the intel file she was looking for on a workbench.

Quickly walking over, she sat down on a chair and read through the file. She then tapped her headset and said, "Obtained the Intel file. Big Boss is being held in a hospital in Cyprus."

"Good. Another job completed," Skull Face's voice said from her headset, "Grab the intel file and exfiltrate. Once you are back we will prepare for your biggest mission yet."

Jane grabbed the file and put it in her leather jacket. It was what she liked to wear a leather jacket. She silently unsheathed her trusty knife, wiped the blood off from it and held it in her right hand.

"Killing *the* Big Boss?" she whispered to herself as she started making her way out of the outpost, "That will be the day." Personally she held no grudge against this Big Boss. She merely heard that he was some kind of *War-Jesus* on the battle field. Killing him would make quite a name for herself.

As she jumped on to her black motorcycle she parked outside the outpost, she contemplated about her past. She thought of the hum that her parents used to hum to her. She suppressed the emotions she hummed it all the way back to the XOF safe house.

"Good you're here," Skull Face said as she entered the XOF leader's personal room. She nodded to greet him and handed him the intel file. He put it on a large table which he used to plan out her infiltrations. After giving it a quick read, he said with a low voice, "Big. Boss... It's been nine years. The time has come to wipe you off the face of the planet."

He then turned around and went to the other side of the room to grab a large blueprint. As he laid it on the table and she recognized it was the blueprint of the hospital where Big Boss was held.

"We are going to begin the capture with you. You will drop in here," he said as he gestured to the northern side of the building, "and taking these stairs you will reach the upper level, where he is supposedly is."

"Then silently kill the Boss and anyone who saw me," Jane said, as emotionless as ever.

"Good, you know the drill," Skull Face said smiling and continued, "Don't mess this up, Jane, you know what will happen if you do."

"Yes sir," Jane nodded.

"Dismissed, the operation will commence tomorrow," Skull Face said as he turned around and started to walk to back to his desk. Once he sat down, Jane was already gone.

Jane walked to the right-wing the large XOF safe house. The safe house was actually an embassy, but that was just a front for an XOF safe house. The safe house has two wings, the left and the right. On the left was the officer barracks and on the right was the various work places.

As she reached her own personal room a male officer caught her attention by whistling as if he saw an attractive woman, "Damn girl, you wouldn't mind sharing that booty of yours eh?" Ignoring his remarks she continued to find the keys to her door. "Hey. Don't you ignore me, come on girl, you can ride me for days," he said as he started to walk towards her.

She unlocked her door and started to walk in just as the man's hand landed on her thigh. That, was an action he would deeply regret in a few seconds time. Within a blink of an eye, she grabbed his hand that was on her shoulder and twisted him around.

"Let's dance," Jane said with a menacing voice.

She then quickly pushed the man's head onto the floor, nearly knocking him unconscious. After that, she twisted his arm until a distinctive crack could be heard. She pushed his now broken arm against his head and pushed him onto the floor. His mind failed to process all that had happened with in a second. His screams of agony could be heard as she stood up, purposefully stepped groin, and walked into her room.

After taking a hot shower, she laid on her bed. She thought of the man that she just injured.

"Men, all perverts, talk about love when you guys stop being such asses," she said to herself as she drifted to sleep. Little did she know, one particular man would prove her wrong.
