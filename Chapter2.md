### What a First Impression

> Oh no, not me

> We never lost control

> You're face to face

> With the man who sold the world

Punished Snake observed his surroundings as he listened to the music. The music that had been playing for 10 times in repeat since he awoke. With little memory from any events that happened prior, he scoured the realms of his own minds to see why he was in the hospital. Soon enough, memories came.

"Mayday mayday! Controls are unresponsive. Tower, do you read!?" a pilot said frantically into his radio, "Shit! Comms are down." The memory was then followed by a crash. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't remember anything else.

He grunted in frustration and got the attention of a nearby nurse. After observing him, she quickly ran away to call the doctor. Snake's mind was still hazy and spending all that energy had depleted him. His eyelids soon rolled to cover his eyes once more.

> I searched for form and land

> For years and years I roamed

> I gazed a gazely stare

> And all the millions here

> We must have died alone

> A long long time ago...

**TIME: 2000**

"Acquired disguise, infiltration is underway," Jane said into the radio as she hid her knife within the nurse dress.

"I want to do this the classical way, the knife will be your only instrument. Poor guy won't know what hit him," Skull Face responded over the radio.

Jane took the northern entrance of the hospital just like what Skull Face planned with her. She then walked to the left of her to locate the fire exit and slowly made her way up. The walk was short for her as he mind was preoccupied. A few moments later her hand reached to push the fire-exit door of the 5th floor. She looked left and right, and when she saw that no body was there, she walked out of the fire exit.

Turning right, she spotted a T-junction. Just another right turn and Big Boss would be in her grasp. She slowly made her way there but, just then she heard a voice call out to her.

"Hey! You over there, could you come help me?" Jane turned around and faked a happy smile as she walked over to the nurse who called her.

*"I don't have time for this,"* she thought to herself, but nevertheless, helped out anyway. The nurse had asked her to retrieve some supplies from the supply room, which coincidentally was next to where she was supposed to be. She walked over to the supply room, focusing on the doctor and a nurse who was speaking to Big Boss. *"Shit, he's awake. I better do this quickly then. Should be easy enough, just take out the nurse and then the doctor."*

She went back to the nurse who requested the supply and handed her the salt water bag along with other supplies. The nurse said thanks and went off to her own work. Jane had never been the one to kill if the mission parameters weren't strictly so. She just wasn't the kind of person to be consumed by blood lust. However, she wouldn't hesitate if it came to it.

"...As of today, your name is Ahab. Forget everything, your name, your past."

As quick as thunder she grabbed the nurse and put her into a choke hold, suffocating her. Snake attempted to warn the doctor as he raised his right hand, gesturing to the now-missing doctor that Jane had dragged away. The doctor gently pushed his hand away as he continued, showing him the picture of Snake and his colleges.

Jane heard the sound of Snake's heartbeat increasing, but due to years of hardened-combat, it didn't increase too high. The increased intensity of the beating was only a little noticeable. *"Too bad all those years of combat had lowered your shock, otherwise the doctor made had called the nurse,"* she thought to herself.

Jane walked quietly out and just as the doctor finished his speech, she jumped on to him with her force choke. The doctor was actually more powerful than he looked and was almost able to over power. He tried to kick the bed that Snake was on gain leverage, knocking Snake over in the process. As the doctor pulled out his gun however, she pulled out her knife and stabbed him in the neck. Choppers could be heard as Jane walked into the middle of the room.

"Status report," Skull Face said through the comms.

"Not yet, the patient in the next bed saw my face," Jane replied.

"Then kill him, and Big Boss," Skull Face said back.

"Of course, consider it done," she replied back coldly.

She then walked over to Snake. As she took notice of his flesh arm reaching for the pistol. *"You want to be killed by this? Too bad I you can't afford the luxury," she said as she kicked the pistol away under the curtains of the other patient. With her knife her hands, Jane crouched done held Snake's throat, preparing for to stab him.

A breath later, however a shot rang out and a sharp pain can be felt as a bullet entered right arm. *"Sloppy aim. Should've went for the head," she thought as saw the patient holding the gun that she kicked. Before he could land a second shot however, she closed the distance and engaged in CQC with him. It turns out that the patient could very much hold his own and managed to put her in a force-choke postilion. However she used her momentum and threw the patient towards where Snake was. 

Unsheathing her knife again, she prepared to close the distance. The patient began throwing things at her, but it futile. However, he also threw a bottle of flammable liquid. *"I better not get burnt,"* she thought as she returned the favor with a knife throw to the patient's right arm.

Without bothering to finish him, she closed her distance with Snake and choked him. *"Go to sleep, and never wake again,"* she thought as she saw his eyes slowly closing. The sound of match lighting up however, caught her attention. The origin of the sound was soon discovered as she found herself in excruciating heat. Her body. Was. On. Fire.

She let out screams of agony as she stumbled backwards, but she wasn't about to give up just yet as she tried to crawl towards the patient and Snake. The patient threw a knife at her, but she slapped it away. Just as she was about to reach them however, the patient threw another bottle of that flammable liquid at her, burning her once more. 

She screamed for dear life as she finally gave up and stumbled her way out of the window. The fall was less painful than the feeling of being on fire. She felt saved when she saw a river. She was feeling powerless as life itself began to leak out of her.

*"Just... a few more steps..."*

*"Come on Jane, you can do it."*

As soon as her feet reached the water she lost all her strength and gave in, falling head first into the water.

*"I will kill you, Snake,"* that was the last thought in her mind as it went adrift.
